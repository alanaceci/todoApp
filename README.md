# Productivity Application

I built this application to virtualize my daily "to-do" list. Instead of writing my tasks down on a sticky note, I decided to teach myself React, specifically the difference between React Component Classes and React Hooks.


## Running the App

In the project directory, you can run : 
### `npm start`
